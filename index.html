    <details class="air-purity">
        <summary><strong>Air Purity:-94 AQI US</strong></summary>
        <p>
            Air purity refers to the quality or cleanliness of the air, indicating the absence of pollutants,
            contaminants, or harmful substances. Pure air typically consists of a balanced mix of nitrogen (about 78%),
            oxygen (about 21%), and trace gases like argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapor.

            Air purity is often measured in terms of the levels of pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and
            PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O₃), volatile organic
            compounds (VOCs), and other harmful gases.

            High air purity means the air has low concentrations of these pollutants, making it safer and healthier to
            breathe.
        </p>

    <details class="air-pollution">
        <summary><strong>Pollution:-6.4 PM2.5</strong></summary>
        <p class="put-it-right">
            Pollution is the introduction of harmful substances or contaminants into the environment, which causes
            adverse effects on ecosystems, human health, and the natural balance of air, water, and land. These harmful
            substances, known as pollutants, can be chemical, physical, or biological in nature.

    <details class="humidity">
        <summary class="center"><strong>Humidity:-68%</strong></summary>
        <p>Humidity refers to the amount of water vapor present in the air. It is a key factor in weather and climate,
            affecting how hot or cold we feel. There are three main types of humidity:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Absolute Humidity:</strong> The total mass of water vapor in a given volume of air, usually
                measured in grams of water per cubic meter of air.</li>
            <li><strong>Relative Humidity:</strong> The percentage of water vapor present in the air compared to the
                maximum amount the air can hold at a specific temperature. Higher relative humidity makes the air feel
                warmer than it actually is.</li>
            <li><strong>Specific Humidity:</strong> The ratio of the mass of water vapor to the total mass of air
                (including the water vapor).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Humidity affects everything from weather patterns to human comfort, with high humidity making it feel hotter,
            and low humidity making it feel cooler.</p>

        <summary><strong>How many trees have you planted?</strong></summary>
        <p class="put-it-right">
            Planting trees is one of the simplest yet most impactful ways we can help our planet. Trees are nature’s air
            purifiers—they absorb harmful carbon dioxide, release oxygen, and create a healthier environment for all
            living beings. By planting more trees, you’re not only combating climate change but also helping to reduce
            air pollution, prevent soil erosion, and provide homes for countless species of wildlife. A single tree can
            make a difference, and together, we can create forests that will thrive for generations. Let’s grow a
            greener, healthier future—one tree at a time. Your contribution can make the world a better place!</p>
